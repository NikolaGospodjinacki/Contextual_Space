CONTEXTUAL SPACE


THE PLAN IS TO CREATE A WEB APPLICATION IN ROUGHLY 3-4 DAYS OF WORk
I WANT TO EXPERIMENT WITH AGENTIC CODING AND ALSO PRACTICE MY DEVOPS AND GENERAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ABILITIES
I WANT TO HAVE A MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT, A WORkING CONCEPT BY THE END OF THIS WORk STINT

WHAT DO I WANNA MAkE?

I WANT A WEB APPLICATION THAT WILL ALLOW THE USER TO PUT TEXT BOXES ON THE SCREEN AND HAVE THEM BE VISIBLE FOR OTHER USERS THAT ARE ON THE WEBSITE
SO BASICALLY AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THE VISION OF THIS TECHNICALLY, THESE WOULD BE THE REQUIREMENTS, YOU MAY ADVISE CHANGES AND GIVE INSIGHT WHEREEVER YOU SEE FIT:

I NEED A BACkEND API THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO SEND MY TEXT TO THE SERVER
I NEED A DATABASE TO TRACk USER ACCOUNTS AND CONNECT THE TEXT TO THE USER
I NEED SOME WAY TO DISPLAY THE USER CURSOR AND THE TEXT WHEN HE CLICkS TO  INSERT THE TEXT
I NEED A WAY TO DELETE AND EDIT THAT TEXT
I ALSO NEED A PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT I CAN BUY AND POSSIBLY HOST ON AWS ROUTE43
I PROBABLY NEED A NOSQL AWS OFFERING BUT YOU MAY DISAGREE AND CHOOSE A DIFFERENT TYPE
FOR FRONTEND, I WANT IT TO BE MINIMALISTIC, MODERN, FAST, AND SNAPPY, YOU MAY SUGGEST THE BEST FRAMEWORk AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE THAT YOU'RE THE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH AND HAVE THE MOST TRAINING DATA ON
FOR THE BACkEND, WHATEVER WORks FOR YOU AGAIN, AWS LAMBDA, NODE, SOMETHING FAST AND NICHE, I DON't CARE, AS LONG AS IT WORks 
I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE HOSTED ON AWS
I WANT ALL MY COMPONENTS TO BE MADE IN DOCkER, THE BACkEND SERVICE, THE FRONTEND, DATABASE, EVERYTHING, JUST LOOSLY COUPLED, DEPLOYED ON THE APPROPRIATE AWS SERVICES, BEST SUITED FOR A PROOF OF CONCEPT POC THAT IS DESIGNED FOR A VERY SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE AND THUS VERY COST EFFICIENT, I AM A DEVOPS ENGINEER BY TRADE, SO I WANT TO PRACTICE DEVOPS Skills and have all of this deployed with github actions yaml and terraform, you may suggest additional tooling and whatever you may need to make this project work
You may also suggest buying AI Tools and upgrading your plan to a more powerful model if you think that it would benefit this project in a major way, I am open to spending up to 200 dollars on it.


Okay, so this is the rough vision for this proof of concept
I WILL NEED YOUR SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE, I WANT YOU TO PROMPT ME WHENEVER YOU MAke LARGE DECISIONS
I WANT TO kNOW WHAT YOU'RE MAking 
I WANT TO MAke THIS INTO A PROFESSIONAL GRADE PROJECT, SO CODE MAINTAINABILITY AND BEST PRACTICES ARE ENCOURAGED
PRIORITIZE PERFORMANCE, SIMPLE CODE, SIMPLE SOLUTIONS, SIMPLE CONTAINER ARCHITECTURE, BEAUTY
TEST OFTEN, GET THE FEEDBACk LOOP FUNCTIONAL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE AS A PRIORITY, AND THEN ITERATE
